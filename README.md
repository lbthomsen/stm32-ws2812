## STM32CubeIDE Setup

The folder containing the library source will need to be included in STM32CubeIDE under Includes

and under Sources:

The ws2812 library uses a PWM timer channel to drive the LED string.  This should be configured under timers:

A DMA channel will have to be enabled as a circular buffer:

The "Counter value" is the most important value.  It need to divide the timer clock so that the resulting PWM frequency is exactly 800 kHz.
